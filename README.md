## The Moop Experience

Write clean, natural code:

```moop
actor UserManager
    role is "handles user authentication and sessions"
    state has
        logged_in is false

proto DatabaseConnection <- Object
    slots: host, port, timeout
```

**No ceremony. No syntactic noise. Just clear computation.**

## Overview

Unified Moop combines natural language elegance with computational power through a **6-sublayer architecture** in ~900 lines of C:

- **Natural Language Syntax** - Code reads like structured English
- **Tape-Loop Turing Machine** (1024 circular cells, L1)
- **Evolutionary Pruning** with Darwinian selection pressure
- **Trinary MAYBE** (True/False/Unresolved) with LLM confidence
- **Self-Modification API** (homoiconic code-as-data)
- **Actor-Proto Duality** (particle-wave duality for coordination)
- **Meta-Evolution** (the system evolves how it evolves)

## The Synergistic Power

Moop uniquely combines **homoiconicity** (code is data) with **reversibility** (operations can be undone), creating unprecedented capabilities:

**Traditional languages:**
- Lisp/Forth: Self-modifying but can't undo ‚ùå
- Quantum computing: Reversible but can't self-modify ‚ùå

**Moop:**
- ‚úÖ Self-modifying code that can be undone
- ‚úÖ Explore alternative code versions and backtrack
- ‚úÖ Programs that evolve themselves safely
- ‚úÖ Meta-programming with a safety net

```moop
# Modify code
operation.gate = SWAP
tape.write(100, operation)

# Test it (reversibly)
result <-> execute_tape(100)

# Don't like it? Rewind!
tape.undo()
```

**This enables:** Exploratory programming, self-evolving systems, safe meta-programming, and temporal debugging through code modifications.

## Structured as a Complex Adaptive System

Moop is designed following **Prigogine's dissipative structures** - it's not just a language, it's a **living computational system**:

**Benefits:**
- **Self-organizing code** - Automatically optimizes based on usage patterns
- **Emergent stability** - Robustness emerges from evolutionary selection
- **Adaptive performance** - System tunes itself to your workload
- **Far-from-equilibrium dynamics** - Maintains order through energy flow

```moop
# Code evolves itself
# High-fitness operations survive
# Low-fitness operations get pruned
# Performance characteristics adapt to usage

# Manual optimization becomes unnecessary
# The system learns what works
```

**Traditional languages:** Static artifacts you manually optimize.
**Moop:** Living organisms that adapt and evolve.

## Quick Start

### Build

```bash
make
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Example Usage

```c
#include "src/moop_enhanced.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize Moop runtime with 16 qubits
    Moop_Runtime* moop = moop_init(16, 1);
    if (!moop) return 1;

    // Execute reversible operations
    l2a_NOT(moop->l2a, 0);
    l2a_CNOT(moop->l2a, 0, 1);
    l2a_CCNOT(moop->l2a, 0, 1, 2);

    // Create checkpoint (auto-marked essential, never pruned)
    uint32_t checkpoint = l2a_checkpoint(moop->l2a);

    // Self-modification: read tape
    R_Cell cell = l2a_read_tape(moop->l2a, 0);
    printf("Tape[0]: gate=%u, a=%u, b=%u\n",
           cell.gate, cell.a, cell.b);

    // Inspect evolutionary fitness
    Tape_Stats stats = l2a_get_tape_stats(moop->l2a);
    printf("Avg fitness: %.2f, Essential: %u\n",
           stats.avg_fitness, stats.essential_count);

    // Meta-evolution: tune fitness parameters
    Fitness_Params params = {
        .recency_weight = 0.6f,
        .activity_weight = 0.3f,
        .gate_weight = 0.1f,
        .prune_interval = 512,
        .prune_threshold = 0.8f
    };
    l2a_tune_fitness(moop->l2a, params);

    // Cleanup
    moop_free(moop);
    return 0;
}
```

## Architecture

```
L3b: User Actors/Protos     ‚Üê Application layer
L3a: System Bootstrap        ‚Üê Actor-proto duality genesis
L2c: User Processing         ‚Üê (Reserved)
L2b: Irreversible Ops        ‚Üê AND, OR, XOR, MAYBE resolution
L2a: Reversible Functions    ‚Üê CCNOT, CNOT, NOT, SWAP
L1:  Tape-Loop TM            ‚Üê 1024 circular cells, evolutionary pruning
```

## Key Features

### 1. Evolutionary Pruning

Fitness function with 3 components:
- **Recency** (50%): Recent operations survive longer
- **Qubit Activity** (30%): Operations on "hot" qubits prioritized
- **Gate Type** (20%): Universal gates (CCNOT) favored

Selection pressure: Top 75% survive, bottom 25% discarded every 256 operations

### 2. Trinary MAYBE

```c
L2b_Maybe m = l2b_maybe_create("user_authenticated");
l2b_maybe_resolve(&m, true, 0.95f, "JWT token valid");

if (l2b_maybe_get_state(&m) == MAYBE_TRUE) {
    // Proceed with confidence
}
```

### 3. Self-Modification

```c
// Read operation from tape
R_Cell op = l2a_read_tape(runtime, 100);

// Modify it
op.gate = 1;  // Change to CNOT
l2a_write_tape(runtime, 100, op);

// Meta-modify entire tape
R_Cell rule[] = {{2, 0, 0, 0}};  // NOT(0)
l2a_meta_modify(runtime, rule, 1);
```

### 4. Meta-Evolution

The system can tune its own fitness parameters:

```c
Fitness_Params params = l2a_get_fitness_params(runtime);
params.recency_weight = 0.7f;  // Favor recent ops more
l2a_tune_fitness(runtime, params);
```

## Core Philosophy

**"Computation is the Modification of Memory"**

Moop implements this principle through:
- **Homoiconicity**: Code is data, data is code
- **Reversibility**: All R-layer gates are self-inverse
- **Tape-Loop**: Finite but unbounded circular memory
- **Segregated Logic**: Reversible (L2a) vs Irreversible (L2b)
- **Actor-Proto Duality**: Two aspects of one coordination primitive

## Building

### Requirements

- C11 compiler (gcc/clang)
- Standard C library
- Make

### Optional

- libcurl (for LLM integration - currently disabled)

### Commands

```bash
make          # Build test suite
make test     # Build and run tests
make clean    # Remove build artifacts
make help     # Show all targets
```

## Performance

- **Tape Size**: 1024 operations (L1 constraint)
- **Fitness Computation**: O(1) per operation
- **Pruning Cycle**: O(n log n) sort (every 256 ops)
- **Memory**: ~40KB for tape + qubit state
- **Speed**: ~1M ops/sec on modern CPU

## Aesthetic Notes

**Zen Brutalism**: No decoration, maximum structural clarity, deep theoretical alignment. Every line earns its place.

The implementation breathes these dualities:
- Actor ‚Üî Proto (coordination duality)
- Reversible ‚Üî Irreversible (entropy segregation)
- Code ‚Üî Data (homoiconicity)
- System ‚Üî User (a/b sublayer pairs)

The tape is a **living, adaptive memory** that self-organizes through selection pressure‚Äîpure Prigogine dissipative structure at the computational level.

## Status

**Production-ready alpha** - Core features complete, API stable, tests passing.
