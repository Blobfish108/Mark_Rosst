### Moop (Unified Moop)

**[Moop](https://github.com/Blobfish108/Miley-the-dog)** - Quantum-ready C implementation with embedded systems focus

Moop and Trinity Vibe share the same philosophical foundations but serve different purposes:

**Shared Philosophy:**
- Homoiconicity (code as data)
- Structural reversibility (time-travel debugging)
- Three-layer architecture (Functions/Actors/Prototypes)
- Non-Von Neumann computational model

**Moop's Focus:**
- Native C implementation (~900 lines)
- Quantum-ready reversible gates (CCNOT, CNOT, NOT, SWAP)
- Embedded systems (40KB footprint, no GC)
- Production deployment, deterministic real-time
- Classical by default, quantum-compatible by design

**Trinity Vibe's Focus:**
- Browser-based (JavaScript, no build step)
- "Memory-as-computation" model
- Interactive exploration and visualization
- Web deployment, rapid prototyping

**Think of them as:**
- **Trinity Vibe**: Web-based laboratory for exploring reversible homoiconic programming
- **Moop**: Production-ready implementation with quantum compatibility and embedded focus

Both projects explore how reversibility + homoiconicity creates new programming paradigms. Trinity Vibe prioritizes accessibility and experimentation; Moop prioritizes performance and future-proofing for the quantum era.

**When to use Trinity Vibe:**
- Learning and experimenting with reversible programming concepts
- Web-based prototypes and demos
- Interactive visualization of computational reversibility
- No installation required (just open index.html)

**When to use Moop:**
- Embedded systems and IoT devices
- Future quantum computing applications
- Real-time deterministic systems
- Performance-critical applications
- Research in quantum-ready language design

**This creates a clear complementary relationship:**
- Trinity Vibe = Exploration & Education (Web)
- Moop = Production & Performance (Native + Quantum)
