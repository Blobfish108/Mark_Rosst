# Moop Syntax Showcase

**Code that reads like structured English â€¢ Quorum's naturalism + Io's minimalism**

This showcases Moop's actual syntax with real examples from the language specification.

---

## Core Design Principles

### Pythonic Whitespace
Moop uses **indentation for structure** like Python - no curly braces, no semicolons:

```moop
actor Calculator
    state has                  # Indentation shows structure
        history is []
        last_result is 0

    handlers
        on compute(x, y)       # Deeper indentation = nested scope
            result <-> x + y   # Even deeper = method body
            return result
```

**Whitespace is meaningful.** Clean visual hierarchy, no punctuation noise.

### The Three Arrows

Moop uses **three arrows** for different semantic layers:

```moop
# <- Structural (S-layer): Inheritance, binding
ChildProto <- ParentProto
variable <- value

# -> Dissipative (D-layer): Message passing, irreversible operations
actor -> message(data)
output -> "Hello"

# <-> Reversible (R-layer): Bidirectional computation, can be undone
result <-> reversible_operation(input)
answer <-> calculate(42 + 17)
```

**Three arrows. Three layers. Complete semantic clarity.**

## Example 1: Proto with Methods

```moop
proto MathProto <- ObjectProto
    slots: precision

    methods
        add(a, b)
            result <-> a + b      # Reversible computation
            return result

        factorial(n)
            if n <= 1
                return 1
            else
                prev <-> self.factorial(n - 1)
                result <-> n * prev
                return result
```

**Notice:**
- `<-` for inheritance
- `<->` for reversible mathematical operations
- Natural `slots:` declaration
- Methods read like functions
- No semicolons, minimal punctuation
- Pythonic indentation

---

## Example 2: Actor with State and Handlers

```moop
actor Calculator
    role is "Perform calculations with history"

    state has
        history is []
        last_result is 0

    handlers

    on compute(operation, args)
        maybe result is MathProto.call(operation, args)

        when result is defined:
            state.last_result = result
            state.history.append({op: operation, result: result})
            output -> "Result: " + result
        otherwise:
            output -> "Computation failed"

    on undo
        if history.length > 0
            state.history.pop()
            restore_checkpoint(history.length)
```

**Notice:**
- `role is` describes purpose in English
- `state has` declares state naturally
- `on <message>` for message handlers
- `maybe` for uncertain computation
- `when ... is defined:` / `otherwise:` for MAYBE logic
- `->` for output and messages

---

## Example 3: Message Passing

```moop
# Create actor
calc <- Calculator.spawn()

# Send messages with ->
calc -> compute("factorial", [5])
calc -> compute("add", [10, 20])
calc -> undo
```

**Notice:**
- `<-` for assignment/binding
- `->` for sending messages
- Natural method call syntax

---

## Example 4: Proto Inheritance Chain

```moop
proto Point <- ObjectProto
    slots: x, y

    methods
        distance_to(other)
            dx = self.x - other.x
            dy = self.y - other.y
            return sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

proto Point3D <- Point
    slots: z    # Inherits x, y from Point

    methods
        distance_to(other)
            dx = self.x - other.x
            dy = self.y - other.y
            dz = self.z - other.z
            return sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz)
```

**Notice:**
- Clean inheritance with `<-`
- Method override just works
- Inherits slots automatically

---

## Example 5: Trinary MAYBE Logic

```moop
maybe user_authenticated is check_credentials(username, password)

when user_authenticated is true:
    session <- create_session(user)
    output -> "Login successful"

when user_authenticated is false:
    output -> "Login failed"

otherwise:
    # Still uncertain (e.g., waiting for 2FA)
    output -> "Awaiting multi-factor authentication"
```

**Notice:**
- `maybe` for uncertain values
- `when ... is true:` / `is false:` / `otherwise:`
- Natural English phrasing

---

## Example 6: Reversible Computation (<->)

The `<->` arrow enables **bidirectional computation** - operations that can be undone:

```moop
# Mathematical operations are reversible
result <-> calculate(42 + 17)
# result = 59, and the system knows 59 came from 42 + 17

# Can decompose back
components <-> decompose(result)
# components = [42, 17]

# Complex mathematical transformations
encrypted <-> encrypt(message, key)
# Later, can reverse it
message <-> decrypt(encrypted, key)

# Reversible actor operations
actor Calculator
    state has
        history is []

    handlers

    on compute(operation, args)
        result <-> MathProto.call(operation, args)  # Reversible
        state.history.append({op: operation, result: result})
        output -> "Result: " + result               # Irreversible I/O

    on undo
        if history.length > 0
            state.history.pop()
            # R-layer automatically maintains reversibility
            restore_checkpoint(history.length)
```

**The power of `<->`:**
- **Mathematical reversibility**: `42 + 17 <-> 59` maintains the relationship
- **Undo/redo**: System tracks how values were computed
- **Decomposition**: Can reconstruct inputs from outputs
- **Debugging**: Can rewind computation to any point

**Contrast with `->`:**
- `output -> "Hello"` is **irreversible** (can't "un-print")
- `result <-> 2 + 2` is **reversible** (system knows result came from 2+2)

---

## Example 7: Natural Language Actor Definition

From the test suite - this is what actual Moop code looks like:

```moop
actor UserManager
    role is "handles user authentication and sessions"
    state has
        logged_in is false
```

**And proto definitions:**

```moop
proto DatabaseConnection <- Object
    slots: host, port, timeout
```

**That's real Moop code!** No curly braces, no semicolons, just English.

---

## Example 7: Complex Actor with MAYBE

```moop
actor AuthenticationService
    role is "Manages user authentication with confidence scoring"

    state has
        active_sessions is {}
        failed_attempts is 0

    handlers

    on authenticate(username, password, mfa_code)
        # Check credentials
        maybe credentials_valid is verify_password(username, password)
        maybe mfa_valid is verify_mfa(mfa_code)

        # Combine confidence scores
        when credentials_valid is true and mfa_valid is true:
            session <- create_session(username)
            active_sessions[username] = session
            failed_attempts = 0
            output -> "Authentication successful"

        when credentials_valid is false:
            failed_attempts = failed_attempts + 1
            output -> "Invalid credentials"

        otherwise:
            output -> "Awaiting verification"

    on logout(username)
        if username in active_sessions:
            destroy_session(active_sessions[username])
            delete active_sessions[username]
            output -> "Logged out successfully"
```

**Notice:**
- Multiple `maybe` values
- Combined conditions with `and`
- Dictionary/map syntax `{}`
- Natural control flow

---

## Example 8: Self-Modifying Code

```moop
# Read the tape (code is data)
operation <- tape.read(index)

# Modify it
operation.gate = NOT
operation.target = 5

# Write it back (data is code)
tape.write(index, operation)

# The system has modified its own behavior
```

**Homoiconicity:** Code and data are the same thing.

---

## Example 9: Meta-Evolution

```moop
# The system can tune how it evolves
fitness_params <- system.get_fitness_params()

fitness_params.recency_weight = 0.7
fitness_params.activity_weight = 0.2
fitness_params.gate_weight = 0.1

system.tune_fitness(fitness_params)

# Now the evolutionary pressure has changed
```

**Meta-evolution:** The system evolves how it evolves.

---

## Comparison: Same Logic, Different Languages

### Python
```python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
        self.last_result = 0

    def compute(self, operation, args):
        result = getattr(self, operation)(*args)
        self.last_result = result
        self.history.append({'op': operation, 'result': result})
        print(f"Result: {result}")
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
class Calculator {
    constructor() {
        this.history = [];
        this.lastResult = 0;
    }

    compute(operation, args) {
        const result = this[operation](...args);
        this.lastResult = result;
        this.history.push({op: operation, result: result});
        console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
    }
}
```

### Moop
```moop
actor Calculator
    role is "Perform calculations with history"

    state has
        history is []
        last_result is 0

    handlers

    on compute(operation, args)
        result = self.call(operation, args)
        state.last_result = result
        state.history.append({op: operation, result: result})
        output -> "Result: " + result
```

**See the difference?**
- No `class`, `constructor`, `__init__` ceremony
- No `self` parameter declarations
- Natural English phrases: `role is`, `state has`, `on`
- Message handlers instead of methods
- Reads like a specification

### Language Constructs

| Syntax | Meaning | Layer |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `proto ... <- ...` | Prototype definition | S-layer |
| `actor ...` | Actor definition | S-layer |
| `role is` | Actor purpose (English) | S-layer |
| `state has` | State declaration (English) | S-layer |
| `slots:` | Proto slots | S-layer |
| `methods` | Method definitions | S-layer |
| `handlers` | Message handlers | S-layer |
| `on <message>` | Handle message | D-layer |
| `maybe` | Uncertain value | D-layer |
| `when ... is defined:` | MAYBE resolved | D-layer |
| `otherwise:` | MAYBE fallback | D-layer |
| `output ->` | Side effect (irreversible) | D-layer |
| `is`, `has` | Natural linking verbs | All |
| Indentation | Block structure (Pythonic) | All |

## Philosophy

**Quorum's naturalism:**
- `role is "description"`
- `state has field is value`
- `when condition is true:`
- Natural language verbs and structure

**Io's minimalism:**
- Everything is message passing
- Prototype-based (no classes)
- Three arrows: `<-`, `->`, `<->`
- No ceremony, no boilerplate

**Python's elegance:**
- Indentation for structure
- No curly braces, no semicolons
- Whitespace is meaningful
- Visual clarity through spacing

**The result:**
- Code that reads like structured English
- Pythonic whitespace discipline
- Three arrows capture all semantics
- Minimal punctuation, maximum expressiveness
- Elegant, powerful, and reversible
